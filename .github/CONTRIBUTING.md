# Contributing

## Issues

New bug reports and feature requests are welcome. You are also welcome to contribute by adding helpful comments on an existing issue.

I maintain the project in my own time, but you can expect a response within 7 days.

## Pull Requests

Before contributing large or high impact changes, open an issue for discussion with a project maintainer before submitting a pull request. This saves you from doing extra work that may or may not be merged.

Follow the existing code-style, which is influenced by Google's [Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml).

Please submit pull requests against the `develop` branch. This allows convenient testing and tweaks before eventual release to `master`.
